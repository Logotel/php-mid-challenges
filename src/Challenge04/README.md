# LOGOTEL CHALLANGE 04: CREATE THE CLASS ðŸª‘

### Goal

Create the IceCream methods.

Methods to be implemented (see Challenge04Test):

- `addTaste()`: can accept a string (single taste) or an array of strings (multiple taste)
- `tastesCount()`: return the tastes count
- `empty()`: empty the tastes
- `price()`: get the price calculated:
    - 1 for the icecream itself
    - 2 for each taste
    - Example: an icecream with one taste is 3â‚¬, with 4 tastes is 9â‚¬
    - NOTE: if there is no taste (empty) the price will be 0â‚¬
- `getCoupon()`: if the number of taste is:
    - < 5: should output 0
    - = 5: should output 1
    - > 5: should output 2


### What we will be focused on

- Code style
- Corde readability
- Comments (if necessary)
- Optimization
- SOLID principles
- The test should pass

### Test

Test with instruction in root directory.
