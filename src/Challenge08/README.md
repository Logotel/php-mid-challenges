# LOGOTEL CHALLANGE 07: MAGIC PHP 2 ðŸª„

### Goal

The challenge is to create a PHP class (ACL.php) that can manage access control for a fictional website. The class should allow the creation of user roles and permissions, and then check whether a user has access to a certain page or action based on their assigned role and permissions.

Here are the specific requirements for the challenge:

 - The PHP class should have functions to create, edit, and delete user roles and permissions.
 - The class should allow the assignment of multiple permissions to a role.
 - The class should allow the assignment of one or more roles to a user.
 - The class should have a function to check whether a user has access to a certain page or action based on their assigned roles and permissions.
 - The class should be well-documented, with clear comments and explanations of its functions and usage.

Your task is to complete the above class by implementing the functions outlined in the comments. Once completed, you should write some sample code that uses the ACL class to demonstrate its functionality.

Note: ACL.php is just a starting point. You are free to modify the class and its functions as needed to complete the challenge. Take in mind that the test should not be modified.

### What we will be focused on

- Code style
- Corde readability
- Comments (if necessary)
- Optimization
- SOLID principles
- The test should pass

### Test

Test with instruction in root directory.
